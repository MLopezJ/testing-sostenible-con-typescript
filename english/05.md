# Unit tests

A unit test is a program created to check if a piece of code is having the expected behavior. 

The intention of this effort is to ensure the code has the behavior wanted. it is not to have one test per function or to archive 100% test coverage. This is important to know because depending on the behavior we want to check, we can play with the granularity of the test and this way ensure the app is working as expected and have a rational use of time. 

Following the last comment, became even more important to have tests with high quality. But, how are the tests with high quality?

* They are atomics: one test per behavior
* They are maintainable and readable: code quality should be the same as function quality
* They don't have dependencies on each other: they don't share state
* They are fasts
* They are deterministic: That they are automatic is very important here.
