# Importance of testing

The software is not a static entity, it is a changing entity by nature. In this context, the tests are essential because they become a safety net that allows us to guarantee that the movements that arise there will not break the functionalities that the software is expected to perform, and if something breaks, the safety net will allow you to more easily map where this occurs.

Some developers choose to skip the implementation of automatic tests with the intention of “gaining” time for the development of new features, however, this decision takes its toll when it is desired to implement new functionality or fix bugs

By ignoring the creation of automatic tests, the opportunity to use those as a tool for software design is lost, which when present helps to decrease the accidental complexity of the code.
